## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains the full analysis script for a book sales dataset. The project aims to provide a comprehensive, data-driven understanding of key performance indicators (KPIs), author impact, sales distributions, and revenue trends.

The core analysis covers:
* **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, type conversion, and handling missing values.
* **Performance Ranking:** Identifying top-performing authors and publishers by gross sales and revenue.
* **Engagement Analysis:** Exploring the correlation between author rating, book quality, and reader engagement (ratings count).
* **Market Segmentation:** Analyzing language distribution and sales volume by publishing year.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Dependencies

This analysis was performed using standard Python libraries commonly used in data analysis.

* **Python** (3.x)
* **Pandas:** For data loading, cleaning, and aggregation (`groupby`, `sum`, `mean`).
* **NumPy:** For core numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For generating visualizations (bar plots, box plots, scatter plots, line plots).

## 📊 Key Analytical Code Snippets

The main script executes the following high-level analysis steps:

* **Frequency Analysis:** Visualizing the number of books per genre.
* **Distribution Analysis:** Comparing the spread of book ratings count and units sold across author ratings using **box plots**.
* **Correlation:** Analyzing the relationship between price and units sold, and average rating and ratings count using **scatter plots**.
* **Time-Series Trend:** Tracking total units sold over different publishing years using a **line plot**.
* **Revenue Ranking:** Calculating and visualizing total gross sales by author and publisher.

**Execute the Script:** Run the main analysis script (e.g., `analysis.py` or your Jupyter Notebook).
